GI.seminr               Calculates the intrinsic, forward and backward
                        generation interval distributions for SEmInR
                        epidemic model.  The SEmInR model is an
                        epidemiological model that compartments
                        individuals by stages of infections: S for
                        susceptible, E for exposed (infected but not
                        yet infectious), I infectious and R for
                        individuals removed from the model (following
                        recovery and immunity, deaths, etc.). In order
                        to have realistic residency distributions in
                        compartments E and I, these compartments are
                        artificially sub-divided into m for E, and n
                        for I. It is not straightforward to calculate
                        the generation interval distributions for a
                        SEmInR model. This function numericaly solves
                        the three generation interval distributions
                        (intrinsic, backward and forward ones, see [1]
                        for theoretical framework).
