GI.resude               Generation interval distribution for the RESuDe
                        epidemic model.
GI.seminr               Calculates the intrinsic, forward and backward
                        generation interval distributions for SEmInR
                        epidemic model.  The SEmInR model is an
                        epidemiological model that compartments
                        individuals by stages of infections: S for
                        susceptible, E for exposed (infected but not
                        yet infectious), I infectious and R for
                        individuals removed from the model (following
                        recovery and immunity, deaths, etc.). In order
                        to have realistic residency distributions in
                        compartments E and I, these compartments are
                        artificially sub-divided into m for E, and n
                        for I. It is not straightforward to calculate
                        the generation interval distributions for a
                        SEmInR model. This function numericaly solves
                        the three generation interval distributions
                        (intrinsic, backward and forward ones, see [1]
                        for theoretical framework).
